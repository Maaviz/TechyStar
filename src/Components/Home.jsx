            American Psycho is a 2000 horror film directed by Mary Harrow, who
            co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner. Based on the 1991
            novel by Bret Eaton Ellis, it stars Christian Bale as Patrick
            Batsman, a New York City investment banker who leads a double life
            as a serial killer. Willed Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Chloe
            Servings, Samantha Mathis, Cara Seymour, Justin Thereout, and Reese
            Witherspoon appear in supporting roles. The film blends horror and
            black comedy to satirize 1980s yuppie culture and consumerism,
            exemplified by Batman and supporting cast. Ellis considered his
            controversial novel untillable due to its graphic nature, but
            producer Edward R. Pressman was determined to adapt it and bought
            the film rights in 1992.
